              My name is Jo√£o Omar, I&apos;m 21 years old, and I&apos;m a Systems Information student.
              My focus is on creating efficient and scalable applications, both on the front-end
              and back-end, using the best development practices.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to JavaScript, I have delved deeply into languages like Python, C#, and
              Golang for different solutions. Furthermore, I have been studying DevOps and UI/UX
              Design to understand how best practices in quality are applied, both in software
              development and in user experience, as well as in the precise definition of project
              requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
              My motivation comes from seeing the positive impact that technology can have on our
              daily lives. I aim to contribute my ideas to enhance and optimize people&apos;s daily
              routines.
